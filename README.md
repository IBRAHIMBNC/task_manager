A minimalistic `TODO` app built with **`Flutter`**. State management is handled by **`Provider`**, and local databases **`Share Preferences`**. The project follows **`Stacked Architecture`** principles for a modular codebase.
</div>

# Design Decision
- **Architecture:** The Stacked Architecture, based on the MVVM pattern, was used for its simplicity and structured approach to organizing code. It also comes with its own CLI tool, which automates many tasks and reduces development time.

- **State Management:** Provider was used for state management due to its seamless integration with Flutter and the Stacked Architecture. It provides a straightforward way to manage the state of the application, allowing for efficient data flow and easy access to shared data across the widget tree.

- **Local Database:** Shared Preferences was chosen for local data storage because it provides a simple key-value storage system, which is easy to use and sufficient for storing user preferences and other small amounts of data.


# Additional Features
- **Current User Page:** An additional feature implemented in this project is a dedicated page for the current user. Here, users can view their personal information, providing a personalized experience within the app.

- **Authentication Token Expiry Check:** The application also checks the expiry of the authentication token. When the token expires, the user is automatically logged out. This feature enhances the security of the application by ensuring that sessions are not indefinitely active, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
